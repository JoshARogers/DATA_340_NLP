# DATA_340_NLP
## Josh Rogers NLP Project

### Proposal
I want to study politicians' tweets because I am a Government major and I believe that we can use NLP to predict politicians' future tweets.  in order to do this, I'd have to scrape data from politicians' twitters. Additionally, I could intertwine tweets from news sources and using both sets of data, I might be able to make a predictive NLP model. 

### What I Hope to Learn: 
I hope to see if I can create a program that would be able to predict politicans future tweets. This interests be because many politicans tend to tweet very cookie cutter talking points, and I personally believe this is a very achievable project. 

### Questions: 
Which politicians should I focus on? Should I look at big politicans such as President Biden, Donald Trump, etc. or should I also evaluate local politicans?

What is the most efficient way of collecting this data? How far should I go back on each persons page? How many politicans should I study? 

Would it be better to predict individuals tweets, or potentially make a tweet that a generic republican or democratic politician would make. 

### Hypothesis: 
I believe that with the way politicans tweet in 2023, I believe that it will be easy to make tweets that sound identical to current politicians. 


### To Do List (February 16, 2023)
Meet with Professor Tucker about best ways to collect data, discuss strategy
Start evaluating politicans tweets
Pick out who's pages I want to collect data from. 
Start researching similar projects to see how NLP was implemented
